# Neuro Environment

**Urban Mental Stress Monitoring System**

## Project Overview

**Neuro Environment** is an urban monitoring system that identifies mental stress zones in cities using environmental and climate data. The project integrates satellite information from NASA and the Copernicus program, vegetation coverage, population density, and air pollution data, based on peer-reviewed studies in environmental neuroscience.

Inspired by Brazilian thinker Ailton Krenak:  
*"There will come a time when the Earth will no longer respond. It will be a dead Earth."*

The goal is to demonstrate the direct relationship between urban mental health and environmental health, turning environmental data into awareness and actionable tools for decision-making.

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive Map
- Implemented with **Leaflet.js**.
- Displays urban mental stress zones in Rio de Janeiro.
- Layer options include:
  - Urban Stress Index (based on the ICCA methodology)  
  - Air Pollution (PM2.5)  
  - Heat Islands  
  - Vegetation Loss  
  - Population Vulnerability  
- Supports zoom, neighborhood selection, and detailed area information.

### 2. Global Statistics
- Shows data on air pollution, mental health issues, urban exposure, and social vulnerability.
- Visualized with interactive charts.

### 3. Neuroenvironmental Analysis
- Explains the neurobiological effects of pollution, extreme heat, and lack of green spaces on the human brain.
- Integrates scientific studies to support public policy decisions.

### 4. ICCA Methodology (Environmental Cognitive Load Index)
- A model that weights different environmental factors to estimate mental health impact:
  - Air pollution  
  - Vegetation and green spaces  
  - Population density  
  - Urban heat  
  - Urban and social stress sources
