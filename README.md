Um Quarto 2.0 developed an urban monitoring system that identifies mental stress zones within cities by using environmental and climate data, including information from NASA satellites.
Inspired by the words of Brazilian thinker and activist Ailton Krenak — “There will come a time when the Earth will no longer respond. It will be a dead Earth.” — the project reflects on the urgent need to reconnect urbanization with nature, recognizing that human well-being depends directly on the planet’s health.
Our system seeks to create this convergence by mapping how environmental factors — such as heat, pollution, and the lack of green spaces — affect the mental balance of urban populations. The consequences of the climate crisis are already visible: 90% of the world’s coastal cities face the risk of flooding by 2050, and these are precisely where most of the global population lives.
With Um Quarto 2.0, we aim to transform data into awareness — offering citizens, policymakers, and researchers a tool that reveals how mental health and the environment are deeply interconnected, and how the future of cities depends on our ability to listen to and care for the Earth.
